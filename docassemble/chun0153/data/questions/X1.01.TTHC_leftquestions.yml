# Just to mix things up, we use a 'yesno' field to ask whether the other person
# had capacity.  We are reducing 'capacity' in this app to just being an adult.
# For the purposes of this app it's too complex to get into actual mental capacity.
question: Who did you contract with?
subquestion: |
  Was the other person an adult?
yesno: TTHCcapacity

# Question to ask if there is a written contract
question: Written Contract
subquestion: |
  A 'written contract' can mean a formal contract document.
  It can also mean any emails, texts or messages you send
  or receive about the contract.
  If your
  messages contain information about:

  - what work was meant to be done
  - how much was going to be paid for that work
  - who was going to do the work and who was going to pay

  Then those messages may be enough to be a 'written contract'.
fields:
  - Do you or the other person have a 'written contract'?: TTHCwritten_contract
    datatype: yesnoradio
